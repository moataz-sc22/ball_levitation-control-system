  The 2 ultrasonic sensors measure the error between the hand and the ball. Then, this error is implemented into A PID controller which is tuned by The Ziegler Nichols method. After that, the PID controller's output controls the fan speed.
  
## components 
###  Arduino uno and 2 ultrasonic sensors 

###  DC fan 

###  transparent pipe

###  ping pong ball

## function 
  The 2 ultrasonic sensors measure the error between the hand and the ball. Then, this error is implemented into A PID controller. After that, the PID controller's output controls the fan speed.
  
## components 
### 1- Arduino uno and 2 ultrasonic sensors 

### 2- DC fan 

### 3- transparent pipe

### 4- ping pong ball

### 5- wooden box
